# Playlists-in-Decades
A web app which allows users to sign into their spotify in order to produce a report of what decades the tracks in their playlists are from.

You'll need to set up your own app on https://developer.spotify.com/ and fill in your CLIENT_ID in the SpotifyGrabber.py file. Unfortunately, only people who you've given access to on the Spotify Developer Dashboard
will be able to use the app unless you request an extension.
