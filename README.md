# Playlists-in-Decades
A web app which allows users to sign into their spotify in order to produce a report of what decades the tracks in their playlists are from.

You'll need to set up your own app on https://developer.spotify.com/ and fill in your CLIENT_ID in the SpotifyGrabber.py file. Unfortunately, only people who you've given access to on the Spotify Developer Dashboard
will be able to use the app unless you request an extension.

The app can be accessed currently from http://dosenchyna.pythonanywhere.com/. Although, depending on the nature of your playlists, there may be some issues (I still need to bugfix).
